It‚Äôs never too packed, and the other members are very respectful and sanitize everything after use. The staff are all phenomenal and keep the gym immaculately clean also. There is no filming before 10 pm, and a minimum age (18, I believe). They also have a lot of great options for pre workout and protein by the scoop, which is great if you‚Äôre out or forgot to pack one that day. 5 Stars all the way for these guys",
